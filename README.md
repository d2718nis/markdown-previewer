==========

React.js markdown previewer web application for the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenge.

The task
----------
[Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need
* You must use both SASS and React to build this project

### User stories
* I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area
* I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type

### Hints
* You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the
  [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) for this
* If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
